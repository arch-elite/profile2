    <h2>Why software development?</h2>

    <p>I have a great love for learning new things,learning what makes things tick and unravelling mysteries of the universe.For me one of the greatest mysteries was not knowing what made a computer work,hours and hours i'd spend using computers doing work without the faintest idea of what was going on the behind the scenes,knowing the real engine and heroes that facilitate all the work going on.Thus tell me a better way of learning than by trying to create one of your own. </p>
</section>
<h2>My Projects</h2>
<p>As I continue all the path of learning coding i have created numerous number of projects although its not quite as impressive as the ones proffesionals do, it's still a start right.pes to high.I mean we all got to start from somewhere.i've linnked them down below so if you want to see them just click the links below. </p>
<ul>
<li><h2>HTML project</h2><p>For those not familiar HTML stands for Hypertext Markup language and basically is the figurative backbone or skeleton upon which the website is built on.During my first week of learning website development,I created a website for a taco shop "The litle Taco shop" maybe you've heard of it.The website is mainly comprises of HTML and has minimal css incoporated into it so i'm sorry it is the most visually appealing website out there.The project entailed using multiple components of html such as the nav ,span,creating image slots and creating lists and contact forms for the website </p></li>
<br>
<li><h2>CSS Project</h2><br><p>CSS stands for cascading style sheets.this is the part used in the website to build upon the html used and gives the website a more vissually appealing aesthetic.so in my project you will see how I mannaged to incorporate css in my original html the little taco shop to create a more visually appealing and functional website.i used colors,created background images,improved the grid layout,used floats and other stuff to make the website better for the user because apparently people only like thhe flashy and extravagant stuff.</p></li>
<li><h2> Tailwindcss Project</h2><p>one of my final projects was working with Tailwindcss.Tailwindcss is somehow common to css,they both do the same thing,which is build upon the original html giving the website a better image.however tailwind is different in that it allows us to make changes without leaving the html file and is less tedious compared to CSS.In the project I managed to use Tailwindcss to create a website ACME rockets using numerous aspects of Tailwindcss such as pseudoclasses </p></li>

                    <div class="card-content"><h3><strong>chess</strong></h3>.I enjoy playing chess.Which other game gives you an opportunity to prove your intellectually superior to your best mate.I enjoy the thrill of playing,looking at the board and seeing multiple possibilities,the one place in the world over the sixty four square spaces and your sixteen pieces where you  have complete control and I also like the thrill of winning,because sometimes it isn't so fun when you are dominated in a game.</li></div>

         <div class="card-content">
    <li><h3>Formula one racing</h3>I also enjoy watching Formula One racing.I  love going karting and trying to mimic racing moves I saw my favourite driver doing during the previous race only to find myself skidding of the track.To me F1 is the pinnacle of motorsport engeneering ,the fact that they managed to create a vehicle capapble 0f reaching over 350 km/h while maintaining enough grip to negotiate the tight corners astounds.i mean most of the new stuff on the modern cars came from F1.If you don't watch it you really should give it a try</li>
